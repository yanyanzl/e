# Maintenance and UI

### Lighthouse UI Siren
  - Siren is a user interface built for Lighthouse that connects to a Lighthouse Beacon Node and a Lighthouse Validator Client to monitor performance and display key validator metrics.
  - docker run --rm -ti --name siren -p 80:80 sigmaprime/siren
  - This will open port 80 and allow your browser to connect. You can choose another local port by modifying the command. For example -p 8000:80 will open port 8000. To view Siren, simply go to http://localhost in your web browser.
  - add --gui --http --http-allow-origin "*" to the lighthouse Beacon Node
  - add --http --http-allow-origin "*" to the lighthouse Validator Node
