# Maintenance and UI

### Lighthouse UI Siren
  - Siren is a user interface built for Lighthouse that connects to a Lighthouse Beacon Node and a Lighthouse Validator Client to monitor performance and display key validator metrics.
  - docker run --rm -ti --name siren -p 80:80 sigmaprime/siren
  - This will open port 80 and allow your browser to connect. You can choose another local port by modifying the command. For example -p 8000:80 will open port 8000. To view Siren, simply go to http://localhost in your web browser.
  - add --gui --http --http-allow-origin "*" to the lighthouse Beacon Node
  - add --http --http-allow-origin "*" to the lighthouse Validator Node

### Geth GraphQL 
  - In addition to the JSON-RPC APIs, Geth supports the GraphQL API as specified by EIP-1767.
  - --graphql flag should be passed to Geth
  - An easy way to try out queries is the GraphiQL interface shipped with Geth. To open it visit http://localhost:8545/graphql/ui

### Metrics monitoring
  - Metrics, monitoring, and alerting are the key elements of a monitoring system. Metrics are the input, the raw data needed for monitoring performance, health, and availability. Monitoring is what alerting is built on top of. Together, they provide insight into how your applications and infrastructure are performing. They detect performance or usage anomalies, help you troubleshoot and identify issues, reveal usage and behavior patterns or trends, and help you understand the impact of any changes you make to your applications or infrastructure. Whenever metrics meet conditions you have defined as part of alert rules, monitoring solutions send notifications prompting you to investigate issues and even help you narrow down and identify possible root causes.
  - add --validator-monitor-auto to lighthouse Beacon Node
  - add --metrics to lighthouse Beacon Node and Validator node
  - download lighthouse-metrics :
      - git clone --progress https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse-metrics.git
  - download docker-compose
      - sudo apt  install docker-compose
  - cd lighthouse-metrics
  - docker-compose up --build (run this command everytime you start the metrics)

  - 
  - Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit. Prometheus collects and stores its metrics as time series data, i.e. metrics information is stored with the timestamp at which it was recorded, alongside optional key-value pairs called labels.
      1. Install prometheus node exporter:
          - sudo apt-get install -y prometheus-node-exporter
          - sudo systemctl enable prometheus-node-exporter.service 
      2. install prometheus:
         - sudo apt-get install -y prometheus
      3. install
         - wget -q -O - https://packages.grafana.com/gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
         - echo "deb https://packages.grafana.com/oss/deb stable main" > grafana.list
         - sudo mv grafana.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/grafana.list
         - sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y grafana
      4. enable services
         - Enable services so they start automatically:
         - sudo systemctl enable grafana-server.service
         - sudo systemctl enable prometheus.service
         - sudo systemctl enable prometheus-node-exporter.service
      5. change the yml configuration files as needed. see prometheus.yml in this branch
      6. restart services:
          - sudo systemctl restart grafana-server.service
          - sudo systemctl restart prometheus.service
          - sudo systemctl restart prometheus-node-exporter.service       
      8. verify the service is running:
        - sudo systemctl status grafana-server.service prometheus.service prometheus-node-exporter.service
      9. setting up grafana on http://localhost:3000
      10.
