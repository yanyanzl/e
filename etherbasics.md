# Ether Basics

## Beacon Chain
    - The Beacon Chain introduced proof-of-stake to the Ethereum ecosystem.
    - It was merged with the original Ethereum proof-of-work chain in September 2022.
    - The Beacon Chain introduced the consensus logic and block gossip protocol which now secures Ethereum.
    - The Beacon Chain is the foundational component of Ethereum 2.0, responsible for implementing the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, coordinating validators, and paving the way for increased scalability and efficiency in the Ethereum blockchain.
